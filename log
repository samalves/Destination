Getting basic form to take input.
  Tue May 22, 2012 at JWU Library 
    10:14am - 10:34am Considered and then rejected adding places autocomplete
    10:34am - 10:37am Set up logging text and write this.
    10:38am - 11:25am Lengthened the focus time to 40 minutes. Got a 'search' box I'm happy with. 
    11:25am - 11:37am Break.
    11:37am - 12:29pm I've got a basic button and a sentence describing what is expected of the user.
    12:30pm - 12:41pm Break.
    12:41pm -  1:36pm Trying to get map centered on destination.
     1:37pm -  1:47pm Break.
     1:48pm -  2:27pm Can't get my app to center itself on the destination. Was supposed to stopped at 2pm, 
                      but didn't. 
     2:27pm -  3:00pm Break. Surfed web.
     3:00pm -  4:03pm Continued trying to get the map to center itself.
